          <h2 class="destination">2. Beijing, China</h2>
            <div class="description">A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues seem to spring up overnight. At the same time, the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasure of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still in viewing the famed Forbidden City and in the luxiriant pavilions and garden of the Summer Palace. <a href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/city-guides/beijing-china/" target="_blank">Learn More.</a>

          <h2 class="destination">3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
            <div class="description">The Korean capital is a city of contrast. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the shadow of 21st-century skyscraper, while the board Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the city centercomplete and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for sidewalk space with fotune-teller and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with endless ranks of identical apartments. <a href="http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/city-guides/seoul-south-korea/" target="_blank">Learn More.</a>
