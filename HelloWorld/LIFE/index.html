    <p>Life is a lesson we all need to go through, i feel like i have failed myself and sometimes i wish i can get out of my head and all i want to do is write, read, talk and advice people. i'm just so scared and nervous and i wondered how i got here i used to be serious, i used to have vision on my own, i used to get excited about my dream, so how did get here ladies and gentlemen, the question we all ask ourselves and we need to stop  asking is <strong>"Why"</strong>. you see ladies and gentlemen i came from a very poor background eating was hard and we barely could feed ourselves and sometimes we wouldn't eat or if someone among buys food, we begged from each other.</p>

<div class="young" id="hope">
  <h1>creation</h1>
  <img src="./resources/css/images/gallery-05 copy.jpg" alt="gallery-05"/>
  <p> I was a young girl with lots of dreams and inspirations knowing and being so sure that i was become somebody in life, yes i was scared of my family that they wouldn't accept me for who i truly am, scared that i'll be like them, scared that i get discouraged for everything i do and also critized by them also, you see whatever i do wasn't enough because it's isn't paying enough but to be honest it's wasn't about the money and it's has never been and what i have ever wanted as a kid was to be on my own, i love quiet places, silent, beautiful places, i love the views even though i'm scared of height, i love being around the rich even though i'm a nervous person.</p>
</div>

<div class="internal" id="aspiration">
  <h1>enlightment</h1>
  <img src="./resources/css/images/gallery-03 copy.jpg" alt="gallery-02"/>
  <p>You see everyday i constantly visualize about myself and my future because i was just so sure about myself knowing that i would be the richest kid in this family and even they all doubted me and they all laughed about it because they don't believe it will be true, i stopped listening to people's opinion about me, i started believing in myself, i wake up every 4am in the morning for my exercises and everytime i'm jogging i'll always shout <strong>i'm the best</strong> people never really understood why i always do that most people laugh, some run away from me and they called crazy while some act like they encouraged me and they are also laughing.</p>
</div>

<div class="destination" id="inspiration">
  <h1>determination</h1>
  <img src="./resources/css/images/gallery-09 copy.jpg" alt="gallery-09"/>
  <p>I remember one morning and i went out to jog like i always do, i got to my destination and i saw a man and he said to me <strong>Get Yourself A Job This Thing Would Never Help You</strong> and i looked back and laughed because i could see the hatred in his eyes like the regret in him, that was his opinion and not mine, someone's opinion doesn't have to be your reality, i was a little girl with big dreams yes i was scared, yes it's normal to feel scared, i have to go through this to learn from it because the bottom is always so noisy and i love quiet places, i know the way to get up was to work my ass up and there's no limitation only the ones i placed on myself.</p>

<div class="hopes" id="time">
 <p class="dreams">
  <h1>elevation</h1>
   <img src="./resources/css/images/gallery-04 copy.jpg" alt="gallery-04"/>
 <ul>
   <li>They don't see my dreams, it's okay because it's was never theirs to see.</li>
   <li>They think i'm crazy, it's normal for them to think like that, name one rich person thats normal, we are not normal because we were never meant to be normal, the word normal is for the poor no disrespect but i'm glad that i'm not normal that's what's makes the person i am today.</li>
   <li>People hates me and that's absolutely okay because not everybody is going to like you, no matter what you do to please them it's never enough, i learnt that the hard way most people that called themselves your friends only wants to see your failure, i always tell myself i don't have friends. it's only me in this world not because i have pride but because it's the only way to remind myself that no-one is reliable. </li>
   <li>Yomi have too much pride, you know what tell me something i haven't heard because all my life i heard that a lot and even my sisters says that to me a lot.</li>
   <li>People won't like you, yes not everyone is gonna like you when i was a young girl doing petty jobs my colleagues never liked me because the customers liked me and always the boss favorite, so most of my colleagues hated that. i always get bothered about that like i don't know how to be playful with my jobs. i would always do whatever my colleagues wants, sometimes i had to quit my job to make them happy because i wanted them to like me but they never did, it's was never enough the love wasn't just in their heart.</li>
  </ul>
 </p>
</div>

<div class="future" id="future">
  <h1>effort</h1>
  <img src="./resources/css/images/gallery-08 copy.jpg" alt="gallery-08"/>
  <p>i wanted people to like me but the more i tried the more i disgusted myself, it's like i was just naive and acting desperate, it's took me a while before i realized that they were never meant to be too much people in my life, even my family i only communicate with few of them, the fact that we are family doesn't mean we are meant to like each other or talk to each other, family doesn't have to be by blood or relatives, my partner can be my family in fact i consider my partner as my family because that the person who accepted me the way i am, sometimes he takes me out to flirt with some ladies and i'm gonna be like you are going to get me in trouble but that's my buddy though, we are young kids with big dreams and aspirations, we went through some ups and downs but we managed to get over it</p>

<div class="different">

    <img src="./resources/css/images/gallery-06 copy.jpg" alt="gifts copy"/>
    <p>it's normal to feel different, it's normal to fail and try again and again, do you know how frustrating it is for people to look down on you, it's just so normal i remembered when there was absolutely nothing to eat then, look at everything i have, i go places where everyone already knows my name and i don't know one of quarter of them in that room, it's normal to fall, nobody ever believe that i was gonna to make it in life not to talk about this huge, instead of trying to be perfect and beat myself down or use negative words on myself, i started to think like a beginner, they was no money but i told myself it's okay, i got insulted a lot i just say thanks and walk away because by getting at them means i'm giving them power towards me, i learnt the hard way and the easy way and i always tell myself behind ever rough road there's always a smooth road. i had to work 3 times harder than i ever did.</p>
