    <p><strong>Mrs Chalton:</strong> I'm sure he didn't mean it like that, he was probably upset when he said it</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Just be honest mom, do i have pride yes or no <em>(was i wrong for standing up for both of us).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Mrs Chalton:</strong> I think we all have pride but how we show it that's what matter and be careful about what your friend's tells you when they are angry, they may be dying to tell you that and he finally had the chance.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> <em>(Sigh).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Mrs Chalton:</strong> Look up, look at me alexander<em>(i raised to speak up and not to be silent)</em> you did the best you can to speak for the both of you, people will judge you no matter what but never look down on yourself.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Thank you mama but i know i'm spoilt.</p>

    <p><strong>Mrs Chalton:</strong> Yes i know that <em>(you are my baby).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I love you mama.</p>

    <p><strong>Mrs Chalton:</strong> Love you too baby.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I have to go.</p>

    <p><strong>Mrs Chalton:</strong> Where you going.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I'll be back soon, i have to take care of something.</p>

    <p><strong>Mrs Chalton:</strong> Be careful.</p>

    <h3>And so alexander went back to carrington's company to make things right.</h3>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> <em>(calling sherley).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Ashley:</strong> Who have the phone that's ringing.</p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> I'm sorry, it's my phone <em>(hello you gonna make me lose my job).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I'm sorry sherley, i just wanna make things right <em>(bryan is really furious with me).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> I heard <em>(what can i do to help).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I just need to know, how can i get to ashley alone.</p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> You're really crazy <em>(you really wanna get me fired).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Sherley please you are the only one who can help me.</p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> Okay it's almost 6pm which means, most people working here would be getting off soon but she always leaves late like 8pm so you have to wait, the parking garage is quiet around that time.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Oh thanks, i'll have to wait then.</p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> Please don't make me regret it.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I won't i promise.</p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> Okay i have to go now.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Thanks.</p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> You're welcome.</p>

    <h3>Alexander waited for hours.</h3>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> <em>(Texting alex)</em> She's getting off now.</p>

    <h4>Alexander managed to get passed the securities and waited for ashley to come out.</h4>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> <em>(What the hell is taking her so long to come out)</em></p>

    <h3>Ashley and Sherley comes out.</h3>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> Good night ma.</em>

    <p><strong>Ashley:</strong> Good night sherry.</p>

    <p><strong>Sherley:</strong> <em>(sherley, she whispered and then she drove out).</em></p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I'm sorry.</p>

    <p><strong>Ashley:</strong> Oh my god, you scared me and how did you get past the security guides.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> I just wanted to say i'm sorry.</p>

    <p><strong>Ashley:</strong> And i asked you, how did you get past the security guides.</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> Please just listen to me, My bestfriend doesn't want to talk to me because of what happened in the morning</p>

    <p><strong>Ashley:</strong> And how's that my problem</p>

    <p><strong>Alexander:</strong> You're right, i just want to make this right by him please, you don't have to employ me. Please just give him a call, he needs it more than i do</p>
